title={Semi-Parametric Control Architecture for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Subject to Time Delays},
journal={IEEE Access (Under Review)},
year={2023},
abstract={This paper presents a data-driven model-based control system for autonomous underwater vehicles (or AUVs) subject to input delays. This work is motivated by the input time delays that can arise in underwater robotics due to communication restrictions and sensor malfunctions. Such delays can highly degrade the performance of classical control structures resulting in unpredictable system behaviours. The proposed control architecture addresses such limitations. The approach incorporates a linear dynamic representation of the system obtained using the Koopman operator in an observer/state prediction formulation. The proposed control architecture is designed based on  discrepancies between the data-driven estimation of the system's behaviour and the actual AUV performance using chain predictors.  The capabilities of the proposed approach are shown through experiments performed with a $4$ degrees-of-freedom autonomous underwater vehicle. The results demonstrate  stable behaviours without steady-state errors, even in the presence of long delay.}, selected={true},

abstract={Research in underwater manipulation has mostly focused on solving individual parts of the manipulation challenge; however, we believe a systemic approach needs to be taken to achieve full autonomy. With this survey, we aim to provide a review of the different dynamic modeling, control, motion planning, and perception methodologies presented in the literature, and, more importantly, we intend to highlight the necessary steps that need to be taken to achieve fully autonomous underwater manipulation.},

  abstract={Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are platforms used for research and exploration of marine environments. However, these types of vehicles face many challenges that hinder their widespread use in the industry. One of the main limitations is obtaining accurate position estimation, due to the lack of GPS signal underwater. This estimation is usually done with Kalman filters. However, new developments in the neuroscience field have shed light on the mechanisms by which mammals are able to obtain a reliable estimation of their current position based on external and internal motion cues. A new type of neuron, called Grid cells, has been shown to be part of path integration system in the brain. In this article, we show how grid cells can be used for obtaining a position estimation of underwater vehicles. The model of grid cells used requires only the linear velocities together with heading orientation and provides a reliable estimation of the vehicle's position. We provide simulation results for an AUV which show the feasibility of our proposed methodology.},
