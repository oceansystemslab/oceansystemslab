     Project description: It is of importance to oil and gas industry to inspect the pipelines laid down underwater for maintainance. Human efforts are not only expensive and time consuming but also there exists a chance of hazard and danger to human divers working on such tasks. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles and Remotely Operated Vehicles have shown major involvment in improving the quality of inspection over last couple of decades and reduction in human efforts. However, there are still challenges to be addressed. One such challenge that needs to be addressed is to track pipelines in and out of burial in an efficient manner. This project will investigate statistical methods to keep track of target(pipelines) using multiple sensors. Data from these sensors will be incorporated in statistical multi-sensor fusion framework using Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter for having better estimates of state of the target(s). <br>

     Project title: Lifelong Learning for Vision based AUV Control <br>
     The main objective is to design a low-level controller for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using learning frameworks. The algorithm should be portable across multiple robots. The controller should adapt quickly to any change in the dynamics (e.g. increase of payload, current disturbances or thruster efficiency decay)

     Project title: Dual-robot manipulation in industrial settings for assembly and disassembly electronic equipment and coordinated actions between human workers and robotic agents using machine learning. <br>
     Project description: This thesis addresses the understudied aspects of robotic assembly and disassembly in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The focus is on developing a fully autonomous system capable of efficiently performing assembly and disassembly tasks, considering the entire chain from design to reassembly. The main objective is to enhance the speed and affordability of production by implementing a vision-based robotic system for electronic equipment assembly/disassembly in industrial setups. The research aims to address uncertainties in end-of-life products without prior product-specific knowledge and explores the potential of physical human-robot collaboration in achieving economic feasibility. The project utilizes technologies for dual-robot manipulation, physical interaction, and machine-learning algorithms. <br>
