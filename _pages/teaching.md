     <b>  Dr. Ignacio Carlucho </b> | <a href="https://ignaciocarlucho.github.io/">Personal page</a> <br>
     He is currently an Assistant Professor in Robotics, Computer Vision and Autonomous Systems at Heriot-Watt University. His research focuses on the development of intelligent robots that can perform complex tasks in real-world environments. Particularly, he is interested in robots that can cooperate with other agents. He obtained his PhD in 2019 from the National University of Central Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was previously a postdoctoral researcher at Louisiana State University, USA, from 2020 to 2021. He then held a position as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh, from 2021 to 2023.  <br>

     <b>  Dr. Maria Koskinopoulou  </b> | <a href="https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/maria-koskinopoulou">Personal page</a>  <br>
     She is currently an Assistant Professor in Robotics and Computer Vision at the Institute of Signals, Sensors and Systems (ISSS), of the School of Engineering & Physical Sciences (EPS), of Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK. She holds a BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering, MSc in Computational Neuroscience and PhD in Computer Science. Her interests and expertise are in the areas of Computer Vision and Machine (Deep) Learning, Robotic Manipulation and Smart Medical Devices. She was recently a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Biomedical Robotics Laboratory, of Advanced Robotics Department of the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), focusing on robotic manipulators and sensory systems applied to surgical scenarios while designing and developing smart medical devices for both intravenous catheterization processes and cancer tissue identification. She has considerable experience in large RTD projects that regards integrated robotics systems. Up to now, she has been involved in various projects related to robotic arms and the relevant object manipulations via those arms, working, at the same time, on the core of Human-Robot Interaction, Vision-guided Systems for Abnormal Tissue Detection, AI algorithms for Industrial Robotic Applications, Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning technologies. <br>

     Project title: Lifelong Learning for Vision based AUV Control <br>
     The main objective is to design a low-level controller for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using learning frameworks. The algorithm should be portable across multiple robots, The controller should adapt quickly to any change in the dynamics (increase of payload, current disturbances, damage to the robot, thruster efficiency decay, etc...)
